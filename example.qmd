# Conclusion

Hope that was fun. You just used your browser's speech recognition API to control these RevealJS slides. You can change the keyword phrases to whatever you want in the YAML header. The defaults are listed in the [repo readme](https://github.com/parmsam/quarto-flashcards/blob/main/README.md#using). There's also some room for customization covered in the README.
